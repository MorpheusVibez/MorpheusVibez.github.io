Finally finished!!! After stressing for a week before the project and a few days during the 1st week I finally settled down and got to work. For me, knowing what i wanted to do was easy but implementing the knowledge and actually typing code was more difficult than I anticipated.

After having getting some help in a study groupchat I came across the major need for object instantiation. Creating the objects was a challenge but lucky most of the work finding the correct values in the api was done already. After refactoring the API class I was able to move on with refactoring my CLI class. Although I could have spent more time creating a prettier code for the CLI I felt like I was spending too much time on it already. Once I ran the CLI everything was smooth except for one more thing.

My list of teams kept repeating itself! This lost of 25 teams would continue to duplicate everytime the list was called. I figured I had to create my team object somewhere else besides my list method but where? After some thinking it made since that when the program is started, the team objects are created then the list is provided to the user. I'm very happy with my work and I look forward to showing all my friends and family my first program from starting my journey to become a software engineer.
