The start of this project has had me worried. I began originally by watching some of the suggested videos from learn.co but had trouble when I couldn't get my API to work. I realized that there was an extra step in setting up your local environment that I missed.

I chose Visual Code for Mac as my local environment since I had seen so many people use it in the videos I have been watching. I still do not understand everything when it comes to this program or CLI's especially setting one up but I am determined this weekend to make an effort to at least get the basics down.

With everything happening regarding COVID-19 i have been assigned to work from home for the next 2 weeks as many others have. I'm hoping this will allow me to spend more time on my project as I'll have easier access to my computer at home. 

As I said before I still struggle understanding where to start with this project but I think I have a good idea on what I'd like it to be about and I'll be working hard over the weekend to at least get my set up completed again.
