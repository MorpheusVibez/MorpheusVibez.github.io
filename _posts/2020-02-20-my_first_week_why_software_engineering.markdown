So the first week of bootcamp was fairly rough. I've tried to set up a schedule of my own to follow which consisted of getting up around 5:30AM, do some lessons before going to work for 8AM, then returning home by 6PM to continue with my lessons until 10:00PM. This turned out to be a tough task to execute.

During the week I managed to stay ahead of the recommend schedule of lessons to be completed which allowed me to take some much needed time to rest over the weekend. Unfortunately I think I may have rested too much as when I returned to my lessons on Monday 2/17 I had trouble recalling a few things. I'm starting to realize that with coding, retention and recalling information is not as imoortant as knowing what to research when you are stuck. My plan moving forward is to stick to a similar schedule of waking up early to complete a lessson or two before work, then continuing on later in the day until it's time for bed. 

The reason I want to learn software engineering is due to the fact that I recognize in today's world, technology is a focal point of it. Rather than be an average consumer and user of it I'd like the chance to help develop and implement technology whether it's something as small as a simple website or creating big projects for Fortune 500 companies or even creating my own form of business in the long run.
