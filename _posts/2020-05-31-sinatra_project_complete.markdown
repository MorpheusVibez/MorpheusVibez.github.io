Today is the final day to submit my project. I am nervous but confident. The past 2 weeks have been really trying for me with the global pandemic affecting my work schedule and ability to effectively work on my project. The last 4 days I have been able to complete my project with success.

When I first started I had no idea what I was doing. I knew what I wanted, but the execution took a lot of patience and googling. Once I got started, the long nights perseded and things started to make sense. To start I went and reviewed earlier labs like the Fwitter and the ActiveRecord lessons helped tremdously with set up. It took me a while to come up with a concept.

I chose to create an app that mirrors a simple and basic admission process. Frustration of course ensued but after watching a couple lectures the concepts started to make more sense and I was able to get into a great flow to complete the project on time.
